# London-Bikes-Rides-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the bike ride patterns in London between December, 2014, and December, 2016. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is visualized in Tableau to understand how weather conditions like temperature and wind speed affect the number of bike rides.

Key Insights:
Total Rides: Over 23,42,294 bike rides were recorded during the analysis period.
Moving Average Trends: A 50-day moving average was used to identify seasonal trends, showing a significant drop in ridership during colder months.
Weather Impact: The heatmap clearly shows that lower temperatures combined with higher wind speeds lead to fewer rides, while moderate temperatures around 7.5°C to 10°C with lower wind speeds result in increased bike usage.
Temperature vs. Wind Speed: The analysis reveals that bike rides peak at around 10°C with wind speeds around 21 kph, where over 102,658 rides were recorded.


Features of the Dashboard:
Moving Average Visualization: A 50-day moving average graph highlights ridership trends and provides insight into the seasonal variations of bike usage.
Heatmap: The heatmap shows the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and bike rides, offering a quick and easy way to compare how different weather conditions affect ridership.
Rides by Weather: Users can interact with the dashboard to explore how specific temperature and wind speed combinations influence the number of bike rides.


Technical Skills Demonstrated:
Data Visualization: Used Tableau to create a clean and interactive dashboard for exploring complex relationships between weather conditions and bike rides.
Time-Series Analysis: Utilized a moving average to capture the long-term trend in ridership across seasons.
Heatmap Visualization: Demonstrated proficiency in using Tableau's heatmap feature to display multidimensional data and reveal trends in the dataset.


Tools Used:
Tableau Public: Built an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to present and analyze the data.
Future Enhancements:
Incorporate additional weather parameters like precipitation and humidity to deepen the analysis of weather’s effect on bike ridership.
Include analysis of ride duration and time-of-day breakdowns to provide insights into peak usage hours across different weather conditions.
